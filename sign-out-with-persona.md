# Signing out with Persona #

Persona makes it simple to sign into websites, but sometimes you want to make sure the next time someone tries to sign in using your computer, they are asked for a password. For example, if you're using a shared computer in a school or library. There are three steps to ensuring this:

* sign out of the website
* sign out of the Persona service
* sign out of your email

## Signing out of websites ##

Signing out of a Persona-enabled website is just like signing out of any other website. It'll have a "Sign out" button: click it, and you're signed out. For example, if you're signed into https://developer.mozilla.org/, you'll see something like this:

Click it to sign out.

## Signing out of Persona ##

However, it's likely that your browser will still be signed into the Persona service, meaning that you can sign back in again without entering your password. This is convenient, but might not be what you want if, for example, someone else might be using your computer after you. To sign out of Persona, visit https://login.persona.org/ and click "Sign Out":

This will make the browser forget your Persona credentials.

## Signing out of your email ##

Even if you've signed out of Persona, if your email provider supports Persona and you're still signed into your email, then your browser will still be able to sign you into Persona-enabled sites without needing a password. So to make sure that Persona-enabled websites will ask for a password next time someone tries to sign in, go to your email and sign out of there, too.
