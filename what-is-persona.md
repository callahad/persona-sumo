# What is Persona? #

Persona is a new way to sign into websites. With Persona, you:

* can sign into websites using your email address and a password
* can use a single password to sign into any website that supports Persona
* can use multiple email addresses, and choose which address you want to use with each website

Persona has been designed from the ground up to protect your privacy and put you in control of how your data is shared. It works on all major desktop, smartphone, and tablet browsers.

## Sign in with your email address ##

With Persona your username is your email address.

You can use any email address, as long as it's one you own (you have to prove you own it). You can use more than one email address: so you could use your work email address to sign into work-related accounts and your personal address to sign into personal accounts.

## No new passwords ##

Most of us have several websites we sign into, and many of us have dozens of them. It's very difficult to remember a separate strong password for each site. Using the same password for every site is easier, but it means that if one site is hacked, the attacker could get access to all your other accounts.

Persona is different:

* If your email provider supports Persona, you can sign into any Persona-enabled website without needing any new passwords at all.
* If your email provider doesn't support Persona, you'll need one new password for all sites.

Either way, you never send a password to the websites you're signing into. You sign into your email provider or the Persona service, which then sends your browser a message that it can use to prove to the website that you signed into Persona successfully.

So with Persona you get the best of both worlds: a single password for all websites, but the password is never actually sent to any of the websites. (Of course, you still have to trust that the Persona server itself won't get hacked.)

## Persona takes privacy seriously ##

Many of our interactions on the web involve sharing and exchanging personal data. As we do so, we enable the companies that provide web services to collect, correlate, and sell information about us in ways we can't control.

Mozilla wants to give the user control over the data they share, and an identity system - Persona - is the first building block. There are other identity systems, such as Facebook Connect, in which you can sign into multiple sites with a single password. But with these systems the website has to "phone home" to the provider - Facebook, for example - which is then able to compile information about your browsing habits for its own purposes.

We've designed Persona from the start so that's not needed. At the moment, Mozilla's Persona service does get to see which websites you sign into, but we're working on removing this requirement, and in future versions of Persona nobody will be able to track which websites you visit.

## Use Persona with any modern browser ##

Persona's not just for Firefox users. You can use Persona on the desktop with any modern version of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera. You can use it with the Mobile Safari browser on the iPhone and iPad. You can use it on Android phones with the built-in Android browser, Firefox and Chrome.
